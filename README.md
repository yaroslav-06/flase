No setup required, just install the apk at [releases page](https://github.com/yaroslav-06/flase/releases) and press change url, at the initial page.\
There enter your server ip in form: 
```txt
ws://<your server's ip>:14539
```

But if you want to recompile on your own, setup flutter for android, and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaroslav-06/flase.git
cd flase
flutter run
```
